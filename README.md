Screenshot Automator
====================

This is a script that automatically frames screenshots with text to accompany them.

Install
=======
Requires several packages, as stated by [the node-canvas documentation](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#installation). After that. install with `npm install` and run with `npm start`.

Notice
======
The script that actually performs the framing, along with the static phone assets, are (almost) directly sourced from the [LaunchKit](https://github.com/launchkit/LaunchKit) source.
